/*    ### Abstract Classes ###

**What is an abstract class in Java?**

A class that may have one or more abstract methods. It cannot be instantiated and must be extended by a subclass.


**What is an abstract method?**

A method without a body (implementation). It must be fully defined in the first non-abstract subclass.


**What's the point? Why are abstract classes useful?**

Basically, it helps create a more clear and flexible inheritance hierarchy. An abstract class allows a general type of or category of partially defined state and behavior that may be inherited but doesn't make sense to be instantiated in its own right.


**Can an abstract class have zero abstract methods?**

Yes

**Can an abstract class extend another abstract class?**

Yes. For example:

abstract class Being {}
abstract class Human extends Being {}
abstract class American extends Human {}
class Fred extends American {}

**Does an abstract subclass have to implement the abstract methods of the superclass?**

No

**Can it define the implementation anyway?**

Yes


**Can an abstract class have static fields?**

Yes


**Can an abstract class be marked final?**

Nope. That would be silly. However, individual methods can be marked final in an abstract class.
